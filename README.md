**Francois le Roux** - Javascript & API & HTML & CSS- I did the JavaScript for the Movie Library along with a little bit for the other pages. I made the HTTP request so that it can danamically populate the Movie Library page.

**Kai Barker** - Javascript,& API & HTML & CSS- I worked on the functionality for the log in page, the entirety of the home page minus the footer (utilising variants of Francois display code), entire watch-list page, functionality for individual movie page, small contributions to movie library namely the buttons on each card. I also worked on the fetching of data from the API and working with that data.
